Replace the well-known stale icon of the TopLeft into a firey WordPress Icon, or into your OWN!

== Description ==

<b>Replace the well-known stale icon of the TopLeft into a firey WordPress Icon, or into your OWN!</b>
<h4>Importance of a different Icon</h4>
Coders are passionate about WordPress but we often feel that clients aren't. There are many plugins out on the web just for the Dashboard customisation, but what they under estimated is the need of new icons for the clients. Clients won't often understand the basic WordPress things. But they surely understand that the TopLeft Logo belongs to WordPress and so we see them requesting their own logo there. Heck Yeah! It is.
<hr />
<p>
So, here... IQubex presents you the only solution to glorify and gift the WordPress dashboard to you. Just you. When you get this plugin, the TopLeft WordPress dropdown disappears. The ordinary WordPress Icon changes into Xtra Ordinary and upon.. In future you may change the Icon anyway you want!
</p>
<p>
Right now, we are sorry that this version of Iconizer (v.1.00) is only determined for the Icon of the most TopLeft. We're soon gonna roll out updates regarding all other icons of WordPress. Stay Tuned for the same.
</p>

== Installation ==

1. Upload `iconizer.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's all. Get your day already made!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin crops any image into that small required size? =

Nope. It won't, yet. This is the early version of the plugin which has kept the idea simple. USE ONLY A SUITABLE 16x16 PIXELS IMAGE or else spoil your dashboard.

= Is there an immediate change in Icons after installation? =

In early versions, you'll see your WordPress Icon glowing with Fire as soon as you activate this plugin.

= Does Iconizer changes only the TopLeft Icon or much more? =

Want much more? Give us a feedback. Then will come the update!

= Does Iconizer allow only images? =

Right now, yeah. Only images. But soon, you'll be getting a Text Box for inserting text instead of icons. If you want WordPress Dashicons, you may be able to put in the CSS code in the next update we roll. Stay Tuned!

= I'm in trouble! Where are you? =

You'll be in trouble if you uploaded a large or wrong file. Well, we can help you out there! Reach out to us at info@iqubex.com for every information you need.

== Screenshots ==

1. This is how you see your new WordPress Icon as soon as you activate the plugin!
2. In the `Iconizer` section, upload your 16x16 pixel file that you dreamt to be on the TopLeft. Then, Click Upload.
3. After you upload, you'll get a message which asks you to refresh.
4. Gotcha! You got it. The ICON of the TopLeft!
